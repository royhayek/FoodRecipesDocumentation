If your admin panel is configured properly, you can connect it to your flutter app, by going to <b>"lib/constants.dart"</b> and changing the <b>URL</b> to your Admin Panel URL.

There is also the <b>APP_TOKEN</b> added for security, you can keep it as default, but I recommend changing it to another random string, you also have to change it in the <b>.env</b> file of the admin panel as shown in the image below.
