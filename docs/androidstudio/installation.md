#### Note 
Flutter relies on a full installation of Android Studio to supply its Android platform dependencies and to be able to run emulators. However, you can run the app using different editors, such as Visual Studio Code, we will discuss that in the next section.


### Install Android Studio

Download and install the latest version of Android Studio from here

```
https://developer.android.com/studio
```

Keep everything as default in the installation just change the installation path if you wish.
